### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Brazil with over 15 years of experience. Currently, I hold the position of Staff Engineer at [MONDU](https://mondu.ai), an online B2B checkout platform that offers "Buy Now, Pay Later" services.

Previously, I served as an Engineering Manager at [VEHICULUM](https://www.vehiculum.de/), one of Germany's largest car leasing platforms. Before that, I gained valuable experience working in various mid to large-sized companies, including Macy's, Bloomingdales, and GAP. During my tenure at GAP, I resided in San Francisco, CA for four months. Additionally, I co-founded a startup called Appontar.

Since 2017, I have been living in Berlin, Germany.

My current technical stack and expertise include Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Javascript/Vue.js and React, Docker, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Terraform, and AWS.
